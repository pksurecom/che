Contributing to Eclipse Che
=====================
Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project Description
--------------------
Che's objective is to create high performance developer environments by producing extensible, RESTful workspaces combined with a cloud IDE that can be customized with plug-ins. Tools are written in Java and run in the browser. If you are new to Che, please see the [getting started guide](http://eclipse.org/che/getting-started/).

Developer Resources
--------------------
Information regarding source code management, builds, and coding standards. All code contributions are made directly through commits or pull requests at http://github.com/eclipse/che.

Reporting Issues
-----------------
A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report,
and will thank you for it!

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on
updates. Do *not* leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they
only clutter the discussion, and don't help resolving it. However, if you
have ways to reproduce the issue or have additional information that may help
resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

* The Che version that is installed.
* The full directory path of where Che is installed.
* The output of `docker version`.
* The output of `docker info`.
* The output of `java -version`.

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (https://gist.github.com).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

#### Report Bugs and Enhancements
* Download one of the latest milestone builds [called nightly](http://eclipse.org/che). Take it for a test drive before the final release and report any bugs you find in GitHub.
* [Report enhancements](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues). Got an idea for a killer feature? Or maybe something you use often could use some tweaking? Post an enhancement request!

#### Fix Bugs or Implement Enhancements
* Is there some bug that really bothers you? Instead of just reporting it, fix it.
* Hope on che-dev@eclipse.org or #eclipseche to discuss feature enhancements and the branching process.

#### Submit PRs for New Templates and Stacks
* We love having people add new stacks (environments for running projects) and sample projects.
* See our [CUSTOMIZING.md](https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/CUSTOMIZING.md#templates) for instructions.

#### Become a Committer
* Committers gain additional rights around managing the repositories and setting the release scope.
* Ongoing plug-in contributors are also welcome to be elevated as committers.

#### Promote Eclipse Che
* Let other people know that your application is [built on Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/artwork).
* Do you have a success story about Eclipse? Send us a story and we'll help you spread the word.
* Present Che at agile, developer, and DevOps conferences. Contact us for free swag to take to the event.
