### Cloud IDE
A no-installation browser IDE and IOE accessible from any local or remote device. Thin, fast, and beautiful - it's the IDE our own engineers wanted ... [Read More](https://www.eclipse.org/che/features/#cloud-ide)

### Getting Started
Che can be installed on any OS that supports Java 1.8 - desktop, server or cloud, and Maven 3.3.1. It has been tested on Ubuntu, Linux, MacOS and Windows. 

Follow the [step by step guide](http://eclipse.org/che/getting-started/) to install Che from our binaries.

### License
Che is open sourced under the Eclipse Public License 1.0.

### Dependencies
* Docker 1.8+
* Maven 3.3.1+
* Oracle Java 1.8 -- compilation with openjdk is not yet supported

### Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/che.git
```
If master is unstable, checkout the latest tagged version.

### Build and Run
```sh
cd che/assembly
mvn clean install

# A new assembly is placed in:
cd che/assembly/assembly-main/target/eclipse-che-<version>/eclipse-che-<version>

# Executable files are:
bin/che.sh
bin/che.bat
```
Che will be available at ```localhost:8080```.

### Build Submodules
Building `/assembly` pulls already-built libraries for `/core`, `/plugins`, and `/dashboard` from our Nexus repository.

To build core:
```sh
# Install maven-patch-plugin as an additional dependency.
cd che/core

# Windows: maven-patch-plugin does not work, so skip tests when building:
# See: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-patch-plugin/faq.html#Why_doesnt_this_work_on_Windows
mvn -DskipTests=true -Dfindbugs.skip=true  -Dskip-validate-sources clean install
```

To build plugins:
```sh
cd che/plugins
mvn clean install
```

To build dashboard:
```sh
# You need NPM, Bower, and Gulp installed.
# See setup in /dashboard
cd che/dashboard
mvn clean install
```

### Run Che as a Server
If you want to run Che as a server where non-localhost clients connect, there are additional flags that you may need to configure. Please see the [usage documentation](https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/usage).
